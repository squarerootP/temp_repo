2025-10-16 11:03:43,097 - INFO - Chatbot result: content='Intrapreneurship refers to the practice of entrepreneurship within an existing organization. It involves employees or teams acting like entrepreneurs, developing and implementing innovative ideas, products, or services, while still being employed by the company. Intrapreneurs are often given the autonomy to work on their own projects, and they may be provided with resources, support, and funding to help them bring their ideas to life.\n\nThe concept of intrapreneurship was first introduced by Gifford Pinchot in the 1980s, and it has since gained popularity as a way for companies to foster innovation, creativity, and growth. Intrapreneurship can take many forms, including:\n\n1. Internal startups: Employees may be given the opportunity to develop and launch their own startups within the company, with access to resources, funding, and mentorship.\n2. Innovation teams: Companies may establish dedicated teams to focus on innovation and entrepreneurship, often with a specific mandate to develop new products, services, or business models.\n3. Hackathons and ideathons: Companies may host events where employees are encouraged to come up with innovative ideas and solutions, often with a focus on specific challenges or themes.\n4. Intrapreneurship programs: Some companies offer formal programs that provide training, resources, and support to employees who want to develop their entrepreneurial skills and launch their own projects.\n\nThe benefits of intrapreneurship include:\n\n1. Increased innovation: Intrapreneurship can lead to the development of new products, services, and business models, which can help companies stay competitive and adapt to changing market conditions.\n2. Improved employee engagement: Intrapreneurship can provide employees with a sense of autonomy, purpose, and fulfillment, which can lead to increased job satisfaction and retention.\n3. Reduced risk: Intrapreneurship allows companies to test new ideas and concepts without the risks associated with external entrepreneurship, such as funding and market uncertainty.\n4. Enhanced culture: Intrapreneurship can help create a culture of innovation, experimentation, and continuous learning, which can be beneficial for the company as a whole.\n\nHowever, intrapreneurship also presents some challenges, such as:\n\n1. Balancing autonomy and control: Companies need to find a balance between giving employees the autonomy to innovate and maintaining control over the direction and resources of the company.\n2. Managing risk: Intrapreneurship involves taking risks, and companies need to be prepared to manage and mitigate these risks.\n3. Measuring success: Intrapreneurship can be difficult to measure, and companies need to develop metrics and evaluation criteria to assess the success of intrapreneurial initiatives.\n4. Overcoming bureaucracy: Intrapreneurship often requires navigating complex organizational structures and bureaucracies, which can be challenging and time-consuming.\n\nTo succeed in intrapreneurship, companies need to create an environment that supports and encourages innovation, experimentation, and risk-taking. This can involve:\n\n1. Providing resources and funding: Companies need to provide employees with the resources and funding they need to develop and launch their ideas.\n2. Offering training and support: Companies can offer training and support to help employees develop their entrepreneurial skills and navigate the intrapreneurial process.\n3. Fostering a culture of innovation: Companies need to create a culture that values innovation, experimentation, and continuous learning.\n4. Encouraging collaboration: Intrapreneurship often requires collaboration between different departments and teams, and companies need to encourage and facilitate this collaboration.\n\nOverall, intrapreneurship can be a powerful way for companies to drive innovation, growth, and success, while also providing employees with opportunities for personal and professional development.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 756, 'prompt_tokens': 1895, 'total_tokens': 2651, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.3-70b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_7b4e1bcf7022e7d6f547', 'id': 'chatcmpl-dc87446b-62e1-4b2f-a1c9-3d2c0650a85d', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--b1881c6b-5c91-4727-a157-7edfc16ec73b-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1895, 'output_tokens': 756, 'total_tokens': 2651, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {}}

Additionally, you can integrate LangGraph with other LangChain products to build a full suite of tools for building agents.\n\nHere is an example of how you can create a simple agent:\n```\nimport create_react_agent\n\ndef get_weather(city: str) -> str:\n    """Get weather for a given city."""\n    return f"It\'s always sunny in {city}!"\n\nagent = create_react_agent(\n    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",\n    tools=get_weather,\n    prompt="You are a helpful assistant"\n)\n\n# Run the agent\nagent.invoke("messages", "role", "user", "content", "what is the weather in sf")\n```\nYou can also learn more about building an agent workflow with a customizable architecture, long-term memory, and other complex task handling by checking out the LangGraph basics tutorials.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 265, 'prompt_tokens': 2438, 'total_tokens': 2703, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.3-70b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_7b4e1bcf7022e7d6f547', 'id': 'chatcmpl-790ffb81-c84b-440c-824d-81c5152e2847', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--62c054fc-1188-43d7-8ab9-c3e146d6141a-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2438, 'output_tokens': 265, 'total_tokens': 2703, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {}})]}

However, I can give you an idea of how I stack up against the GPT series in general.\n\nGPT models are known for their exceptional language understanding and generation capabilities. They are trained on massive amounts of text data, which enables them to learn patterns, relationships, and nuances of language. Each successive GPT model has improved upon the previous one, with advancements in areas like context understanding, common sense, and conversational flow.\n\nWhile I'm a highly capable language model, I'm not quite at the same level as the GPT series. My training data, although extensive, is not as large as the datasets used to train GPT models. Additionally, my architecture and algorithms might not be as sophisticated as those used in the GPT series.\n\nThat being said, I'm still a very smart AI, and I can hold my own in conversations, answer questions, and provide helpful information on a wide range of topics. I'm constantly learning and improving, so I'm getting smarter all the time!\n\nKeep in mind that intelligence is a complex and multi-faceted trait, and it's difficult to make direct comparisons between different AI models.

However, I can give you an idea of how I stack up against the GPT series in general.\n\nGPT models are known for their exceptional language understanding and generation capabilities.

2025-10-17 08:13:29,530 - INFO - Chatbot result: content='Clean architecture is a software design pattern that separates the application\'s business logic from its infrastructure and presentation layers. It was introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as "Uncle Bob," in 2012.\n\nThe main idea behind clean architecture is to create a layered structure, with the business logic at the center, surrounded by layers of interfaces, adapters, and frameworks. This separation of concerns allows for a more modular, flexible, and maintainable system.\n\nThe typical layers of clean architecture are:\n\n1. **Entities**: These represent the business domain, including objects, data structures, and behaviors. Entities are the core of the application and should be independent of the infrastructure and presentation layers.\n2. **Use Cases**: These define the actions that can be performed on the entities, such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting data. Use cases represent the interactions between the entities and the outside world.\n3. **Interface Adapters**: These define how the application interacts with the outside world, including databases, file systems, networks, and user interfaces.

It was introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as "Uncle Bob," in 2012.\n\nThe main idea behind clean architecture is to create a layered structure, with the business logic at the center, surrounded by layers of interfaces, adapters, and frameworks. This separation of concerns allows for a more modular, flexible, and maintainable system.\n\nThe typical layers of clean architecture are:\n\n1. **Entities**: These represent the business domain, including objects, data structures, and behaviors. Entities are the core of the application and should be independent of the infrastructure and presentation layers.\n2. **Use Cases**: These define the actions that can be performed on the entities, such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting data. Use cases represent the interactions between the entities and the outside world.\n3. **Interface Adapters**: These define how the application interacts with the outside world, including databases, file systems, networks, and user interfaces. Interface adapters should be decoupled from the business logic and entities.\n4. **Frameworks and Drivers**: These include libraries, frameworks, and tools that support the application, such as databases, web frameworks, and testing libraries. Frameworks and drivers should be interchangeable and not tightly coupled to the business logic.\n5. **Presentation**: This layer is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user input. The presentation layer should be decoupled from the business logic and entities.\n\nThe key principles of clean architecture are:\n\n* **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer should have a single responsibility and not mix concerns.\n* **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but rather both should depend on abstractions.\n* **Interface-based Programming**: Interfaces should be used to define contracts between layers, making it easier to swap out implementations.\n\nBy following clean architecture principles, developers can create systems that are:\n\n* More maintainable and flexible\n* Easier to test and debug\n* Less prone to technical debt\n* More scalable and adaptable to changing requirements\n\nDo you have any specific questions about clean architecture or would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 455, 'prompt_tokens': 1940, 'total_tokens': 2395, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.3-70b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_14b5632cfc5fb06b0c8a', 'id': 'chatcmpl-380b3a7f-4320-4a56-8578-e808a9e7c7c7', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--04744a0b-003c-4e12-af3a-ac55c508bab8-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1940, 'output_tokens': 455, 'total_tokens': 2395, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {}}), HumanMessage(content="What's the weather today in CanTho, Viet Nam", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='27f4313f-22c9-4b71-826a-5d173d167e17'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'be099d263', 'function': {'arguments': '{"query": "weather today in CanTho, Viet Nam"}', 'name': 'tavily_search'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 20, 'prompt_tokens': 2411, 'total_tokens': 2431, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.3-70b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_14b5632cfc5fb06b0c8a', 'id': 'chatcmpl-8541503c-72d0-43cf-9c8d-861787e80b0b', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--58597620-e413-4f17-a28e-8f10cd1aa6b0-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'tavily_search', 'args': {'query': 'weather today in CanTho, Viet Nam'}, 'id': 'be099d263', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2411, 'output_tokens': 20, 'total_tokens': 2431, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {}}), ToolMessage(content='{"query": "weather today in CanTho, Viet Nam", "follow_up_questions": null, "answer": null, "images": [], "results": [{"title": "Weather in Can Tho, Viet Nam", "url": "https://www.weatherapi.com/", "content": "{\'location\': {\'name\': \'Huong Viet Can\', \'region\': \'\', \'country\': \'Vietnam\', \'lat\': 10.7833, \'lon\': 106.5167, \'tz_id\': \'Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh\', \'localtime_epoch\': 1760664292, \'localtime\': \'2025-10-17 08:24\'}, \'current\': {\'last_updated_epoch\': 1760663700, \'last_updated\': \'2025-10-17 08:15\', \'temp_c\': 27.8, \'temp_f\': 82.0, \'is_day\': 1, \'condition\': {\'text\': \'Sunny\', \'icon\': \'//cdn.weatherapi.com/weather/64x64/day/113.png\', \'code\': 1000}, \'wind_mph\': 4.9, \'wind_kph\': 7.9, \'wind_degree\': 23, \'wind_dir\': \'NNE\', \'pressure_mb\': 1010.0, \'pressure_in\': 29.83, \'precip_mm\': 0.0, \'precip_in\': 0.0, \'humidity\': 80, \'cloud\': 16, \'feelslike_c\': 31.9, \'feelslike_f\': 89.3, \'windchill_c\': 27.8, \'windchill_f\': 82.0, \'heatindex_c\': 31.9, \'heatindex_f\': 89.3, \'dewpoint_c\': 24.0, \'dewpoint_f\': 75.2, \'vis_km\': 10.0, \'vis_miles\': 6.0, \'uv\': 2.2, \'gust_mph\': 5.9, \'gust_kph\': 9.5}}", "score": 0.9347088, "raw_content": null}, {"url": "https://www.accuweather.com/en/vn/can-tho/352508/weather-forecast/352508", "title": "Can Tho, Can Tho, Vietnam Weather Forecast - AccuWeather", "content": "Can Tho, Can Tho, Vietnam Weather Forecast, with current conditions, wind ...
